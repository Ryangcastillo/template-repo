# Task Management

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

### 1. Constitution Phase (`/constitution`)
Define the core principles and constraints for the feature:
- What are the business rules?
- What are the technical constraints?
- What are the quality requirements?

### 2. Specification Phase (`/specify`)
Create detailed specifications:
- What functionality is needed?
- Why is this feature important?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What are the user stories?

### 3. Planning Phase (`/plan`)
Define the technical implementation:
- How will the feature be implemented?
- What components need to be created/modified?
- What are the dependencies?
- What is the implementation strategy?

### 4. Task Breakdown (`/tasks`)
Break down the plan into atomic, actionable tasks:
- Individual coding tasks
- Testing requirements
- Documentation updates
- Deployment considerations

### 5. Implementation (`/implement`)
Execute the tasks following TDD:
- Write failing tests (Red)
- Implement minimal code to pass (Green)
- Refactor and improve (Refactor)
- Update documentation

## Task Tracking
- Use GitHub Issues for feature tracking
- Link issues to specifications
- Use project boards for visual workflow
- Regular standup meetings for team coordination

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Code review is completed
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes
- [ ] Feature is deployed to staging
- [ ] QA validation is complete
