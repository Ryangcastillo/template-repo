# Project Management & Tasks

## Task Management Strategy

### Epic Breakdown
Large features are broken into epics, then stories, then tasks:

```
Epic: User Management System
├── Story: User Registration
│   ├── Task: Create user model
│   ├── Task: Build registration form
│   ├── Task: Add email verification
│   └── Task: Write integration tests
├── Story: User Authentication
│   ├── Task: Implement JWT service
│   ├── Task: Create login endpoint
│   └── Task: Add password reset
└── Story: User Profile
    ├── Task: Profile update form
    ├── Task: Avatar upload
    └── Task: Privacy settings
```

### Task Sizing
- **XS**: 1-2 hours (simple fix or config)
- **S**: 2-4 hours (small feature addition)
- **M**: 1-2 days (medium feature or refactor)
- **L**: 3-5 days (large feature or significant refactor)
- **XL**: 1+ weeks (epic-level work, should be broken down)

### Issue Labels

#### Type Labels
- `feature`: New feature or enhancement
- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `docs`: Documentation improvements
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `security`: Security-related issues
- `performance`: Performance improvements

#### Priority Labels
- `priority/critical`: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- `priority/high`: High priority issues
- `priority/medium`: Medium priority issues
- `priority/low`: Low priority issues

#### Status Labels
- `status/blocked`: Issue is blocked by dependencies
- `status/in-progress`: Currently being worked on

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint Structure
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Planning**: Monday week 1
- **Review**: Friday week 2
- **Retrospective**: Friday week 2

### Sprint Goals
Each sprint should have:
1. **Primary Goal**: Main objective (e.g., "Complete user authentication")
2. **Stretch Goals**: Additional items if primary is completed early
3. **Technical Debt**: 20% capacity for refactoring/improvements

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code is written and follows style guidelines
- [ ] Unit tests are written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests are written and passing
- [ ] Code has been reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Feature is deployed to staging
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are met

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Tracking
Track dependencies between tasks and stories:

```yaml
# In issue description
depends_on:
  - #123  # User model creation
  - #124  # Authentication service

blocks:
  - #126  # User profile management
  - #127  # Admin user management
```

### Dependency Resolution
1. **Identify critical path**: Tasks that block the most other work
2. **Prioritize dependencies**: Work on blocking tasks first
3. **Parallel work**: Identify tasks that can be done simultaneously
4. **Risk mitigation**: Have backup tasks ready if dependencies are delayed

## Code Review Process

### Review Assignment
- **Automatic assignment**: Use CODEOWNERS file
- **Round-robin**: Distribute reviews evenly
- **Expertise-based**: Assign based on area knowledge

### Review Criteria
1. **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Style**: Does it follow coding standards?
3. **Tests**: Are there adequate tests?
4. **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
5. **Security**: Are there any security issues?
6. **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and maintainable?

### Review Timeline
- **Small PRs** (< 200 lines): 24 hours
- **Medium PRs** (200-500 lines): 48 hours
- **Large PRs** (> 500 lines): Should be broken down

## Release Management

### Release Types
- **Major** (1.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor** (1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (1.1.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Release Process
1. **Feature freeze**: No new features, only bug fixes
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all features
3. **Documentation**: Update user documentation
4. **Release notes**: Document all changes
5. **Deploy**: Deploy to production
6. **Monitor**: Monitor for issues post-deployment

### Hotfix Process
For critical production issues:
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Fix the issue with minimal changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Deploy immediately
5. Merge back to develop

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Burndown**: Work remaining vs. time
- **Cycle time**: Time from start to completion
- **Defect rate**: Bugs per feature delivered

### Quality Metrics
- **Code coverage**: Target 80%+
- **Technical debt ratio**: <5% of codebase
- **Code review time**: Average time to review
- **Deployment frequency**: How often we deploy

### Tracking Tools
- **GitHub Issues**: Task management
- **GitHub Projects**: Sprint planning
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD metrics
- **Code Climate**: Code quality metrics

## Communication Guidelines

### Daily Standups
Format: What I did, what I'm doing, any blockers

```
Yesterday: Completed user registration endpoint (#123)
Today: Working on email verification (#125)
Blockers: Waiting for SMTP server configuration
```

3. **Resource risks**: Team availability, skill gaps
4. **Timeline risks**: Underestimated work, scope creep

### Risk Mitigation
- **Early identification**: Regular risk assessment
- **Contingency planning**: Backup approaches
- **Buffer time**: 20% buffer in estimates
- **Knowledge sharing**: Cross-training team members
