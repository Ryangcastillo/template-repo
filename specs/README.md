# Specs Folder

This folder is managed by **spec-kit**.  
Each new feature or refactor must start with a spec (`specify init`).  
Specs are executable artifacts that drive development and refactoring.

Flow:
1. `/specify` → define feature requirements
2. `/plan` → break into implementation steps
3. `/tasks` → generate tasks
4. Code only after specs exist
