This is a placeholder file for the source code directory.

Replace this file with your main application code based on your chosen programming language:

- Node.js: index.js, app.js, or main.js
- Python: main.py, app.py, or __init__.py  
- Go: main.go or cmd/main.go
- Rust: main.rs or lib.rs
- Java: Main.java or Application.java
- And so on...

Follow the project's architecture patterns and ensure all source code lives in this `/src/` directory.
